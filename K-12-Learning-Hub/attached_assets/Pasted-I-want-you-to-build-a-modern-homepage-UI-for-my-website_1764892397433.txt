I want you to build a modern homepage UI for my website that looks similar to a custom private browser homepage. The page must have a minimalistic dark theme, centered layout, smooth animations, and customizable bookmarks. This is the main "Proxy Launcher" page for my site, and users can switch between two proxy engines (Ultraviolet and Scramjet).

PAGE LAYOUT + STYLE

Background should be dark, almost black (#0C0C0C), with a very subtle grid pattern or gradient overlay.

All UI elements should have soft rounded corners (18–24px radius).

Use smooth transitions, shadows, and hover animations.

Everything should be centered vertically and horizontally.

TITLE / GREETING

Centered at the top, large font (similar to the screenshot):

Show a dynamic greeting text like: “Welcome” or “Xin chào!”

Use a sleek, futuristic font.

MAIN SEARCH BAR (CENTER OF PAGE)

This is the most important part.

The search bar should:

Be horizontally centered

Width around 55–65% of the screen

Height ~60px

Background: soft dark grey with slight transparency

Rounded corners (20px)

Contain a subtle search icon on the left

Placeholder text: “Search with DuckDuckGo…”

When the user types and presses Enter, or presses a search button:

Detect the selected proxy engine

If Ultraviolet is selected, open:
/uv/#https://duckduckgo.com/?q=<query>

If Scramjet is selected, open:
/sj/?q=<query>

The search bar should support:

Focus glow effect

Smooth input animation

Pressing Enter triggers the search function

PROXY ENGINE SWITCHER

Place a small dropdown above or below the search bar to select the proxy engine.

Label: “Proxy Engine:”

Options:

Ultraviolet

Scramjet

Store the choice in localStorage so the site remembers the previous selection.

BOOKMARK SECTION

Directly below the search bar, add a row of rounded bookmark buttons.
These bookmarks should be editable by the user.

Bookmarks:

Display 5–8 bookmark icons

Each bookmark should be a rounded square (~110px × 110px)

The icon should be centered inside

Text label under the icon (e.g., “YouTube”, “SoundCloud”, “GitHub”)

Hover animation: slight scale-up + glow

Editable Bookmarks Feature:

Add an “Edit” button aligned to the right of the bookmark row

When "Edit" is active:

Clicking a bookmark allows the user to change:

Bookmark title

Bookmark link

Bookmark icon (optional)

Save bookmarks to localStorage so they persist

Default bookmarks:

CrazyGames

YouTube

SoundCloud

Cineby

GitHub

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BOOKMARKS ARE CLICKED

When a user clicks a bookmark:

If the proxy engine is Ultraviolet, open it inside UV:
/uv/#<bookmark-url>

If the engine is Scramjet, open inside SJ:
/sj/?q=<bookmark-url>

ANIMATION + SMOOTHNESS REQUIREMENTS

All UI elements should fade in softly

Buttons should scale slightly when hovered

The search bar glow when focused

Page uses smooth transitions, no harsh edges

RESPONSIVE DESIGN

Center layout should work on desktop, tablet, and mobile

Bookmarks should wrap onto multiple rows on small screens

Search bar shrinks smoothly on smaller devices

DO NOT build the actual proxy.

Only build the homepage UI with the search bar, proxy selector, and bookmark system that links to /uv/... or /sj/....

END RESULT

The final homepage should feel like:

A premium browser start page

Sleek and modern

Minimalistic but highly functional

With a centered search bar and customizable bookmarks

With proxy engine switching built in
