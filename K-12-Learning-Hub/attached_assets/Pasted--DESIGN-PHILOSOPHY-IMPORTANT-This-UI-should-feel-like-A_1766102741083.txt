🧠 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (IMPORTANT)

This UI should feel like:

A digital workspace, not a homepage

Built for daily use, not just looks

Purposeful, dense (but not cluttered)

Designed by a human who understands UX

Key words:
Intentional • Functional • Calm • Modular • Native-feeling

🎨 VISUAL IDENTITY
Color & Surface

Use soft gradients or subtle noise textures (never flat emptiness)

Backgrounds slightly darker than content surfaces

Cards and windows slightly lighter than background

Gentle blur only where it improves clarity (taskbar, launcher)

Typography

Font-weight hierarchy:

Bold for app titles

Medium for section headers

Regular for content
