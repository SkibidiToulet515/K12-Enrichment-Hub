Your task is to TRANSFORM the current UI into an OS-style interface while preserving 100% of all existing functionality, logic, data, and routes.

This must feel human-built, realistic, and production-quality — NOT AI-generated or generic.

1️⃣ CORE GOAL (MANDATORY)

Turn the current website into a browser-based OS-style interface, similar to a lightweight desktop OS.

This includes:

A taskbar (bottom or side)

App-like windows that can:

Open

Close

Minimize

Focus (active window state)

A desktop / workspace feel

Smooth animations (subtle, not flashy)

⚠️ The original layout must still exist and be switchable.

2️⃣ LAYOUT MODE TOGGLE (MANDATORY)

Add a Universal Settings App that applies settings globally.

Inside Settings:

Add a Layout Mode toggle:

“Classic Layout”

“OS Layout”

Requirements:

Show visual preview images for both layouts (like Windows theme previews)

Changes apply instantly

Save preference per user (or per session if guest)

No reload required

3️⃣ TASKBAR (MANDATORY)

Add a persistent taskbar that includes:

App icons for existing features (games, chat, forums, media, tools, etc.)

Active app indicators

System clock

Notifications icon

Settings shortcut

Taskbar must:

Stay fixed

Work across all pages/views

Reflect open windows correctly

4️⃣ SETTINGS APP (MANDATORY)

Create a single, universal Settings app instead of scattered settings.

Include:

Layout mode toggle (OS / Classic)

Theme selector

Custom theme editor (keep existing theme maker)

Font changer (global font selector)

Notification settings

Accessibility options (font size, motion reduction)

Account settings

Settings must:

Apply globally

Persist correctly

Never break existing pages

5️⃣ AUTH & GUEST MODE (MANDATORY)

On login screen:

Add “Continue as Guest”

Guest limitations:

Cannot save progress

Cannot save games played

Cannot send messages

Cannot post in forums

Cannot create servers

Cannot customize profile permanently

Cannot access admin features

Guest access must still allow:

Browsing content

Viewing games/media

Using basic tools

6️⃣ CHAT SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)
Core fixes (MANDATORY):

Fix forums so posting actually works

Remove any requirement for admin permission to create servers

Chat input bar MUST stay fixed (like Discord) and never move down as messages increase

Add Discord-like features:

Servers with:

Rename

Delete

Invite via generated invite codes

Kick / timeout / remove members

Assign roles

Permissions

Subchannels inside servers

Group chats with same controls

Mentions & notifications:

Typing @ shows user list in that server/chat

@mentions trigger notifications

Notifications appear OS-style (top corner popup)

Notification preferences per user

7️⃣ ADMIN PANEL (MANDATORY)

Admin panel is owner-only and must:

Actually work (no fake / placeholder stats)

Show:

Real user stats

Reports

Activity metrics

Allow:

Ban / unban users

Timeout users

Moderate content

View bug reports

8️⃣ BUG REPORT SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Add a “Report a Bug” feature:

Accessible to users

Submits:

Description

Page/app name

Optional screenshot

Reports appear in Admin Panel

Include status tracking (open / resolved)

9️⃣ PERFORMANCE (MANDATORY)

Implement:

Skeleton loading (preferred over lazy loading for UI)

Lazy loading ONLY for heavy media

Zero layout shifting

Smooth loading states everywhere

🔟 MUSIC APP (MANDATORY)

Add a Music app inside the OS interface.

Technical requirements:

Use YouTube Data API (NOT embeds, NOT iframes)

Use API only for:

Search

Metadata

Thumbnails

Filter results to:

Music only

Exclude long videos

Exclude non-music content

⚠️ IMPORTANT:

This is NOT YouTube Music

This is NOT embedding YouTube players

Playback logic must be abstracted cleanly

If playback is unavailable due to network restrictions, show a clean fallback UI

Music app must:

Feel native to the OS

Open in a window

Support playlists (UI-side)

Work for logged-in users

Guest users can browse but not save

1️⃣1️⃣ KEEP ALL EXISTING FEATURES (CRITICAL)

You MUST keep every existing feature, including but not limited to:

Games

Movies & TV

Chat

Forums

Profiles

Themes

Tools

Calculators

To-do lists

Admin features

Nothing may be removed or broken.

1️⃣2️⃣ ZERO ERRORS REQUIREMENT (VERY IMPORTANT)

You must:

Debug EVERY file

Validate EVERY feature

Check EACH file at least 19 times

Fix:

Console errors

UI bugs

Broken routes

Broken state

Broken permissions

Ensure:

Zero runtime errors

Zero console warnings (where possible)

No unfinished logic

If something cannot be completed, you MUST explicitly explain why.

1️⃣3️⃣ HUMAN QUALITY REQUIREMENT

The final result must:

Look human-designed

Use realistic spacing, animations, and UI decisions

Avoid generic AI patterns

Avoid placeholder text

Avoid fake data

Feel polished and intentional

1️⃣4️⃣ REQUIRED FINAL OUTPUT

At the end, you MUST:

Confirm all features are preserved

Confirm zero known bugs

List ANY steps I must do manually, such as:

Environment variables

API keys

Render configuration

Permissions

Explain anything that cannot be automated

⚠️ THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL

Do not skip steps.
Do not simplify.
Do not hallucinate.
Do not replace features.
Do not introduce breaking changes.
