Your system should work like Discord’s permission model, where each channel has its own rules about what users can do inside it.
Permissions can be controlled at three levels:

Server-wide roles

Channel-specific overrides

User-specific overrides (optional)

Here’s the breakdown:

🔹 Server Roles (Base Permissions)

Roles define what a user can do across the entire server.
Examples:

Admin — full control

Moderator — mute, delete messages

Member — normal chatting

Muted — cannot speak or send messages

These roles set the default abilities for each person.

🔹 Channel-Level Permissions

Each channel can override the default settings, just like Discord.

For every channel (like #general, #gaming, #proxy-links), you can set:

Allow / Deny / Neutral for actions like:

Send Messages – can they type in the channel?

View Channel – can they even see it exists?

Send Files / Images

Add Reactions

Use @everyone

Delete Messages (mods only)

Pin Messages

Neutral = follow the role’s default rule.
Allow = give permission here even if the role denies it.
Deny = block permission here even if the role allows it.

This gives you layered control, so you can do things like:

Make a channel only Admins can talk in

Make an announcements channel read-only

Make a private channel only certain people can see

Make a proxy channel where only mods can post links

Create VIP channels for special users

Give someone temporary speak rights in one channel only

🔹 User-Specific Permissions (Optional)

Sometimes you want to give unique access to a single user.

For example:

One user gets to view a secret channel

One kid is muted everywhere except homework help

A teacher can post in #announcements even without the Admin role

This overrides BOTH the role and channel rules.

🧠 How it all works together

When someone enters a channel, the system checks:

User's Roles → base permissions

Channel overrides for the role

User overrides for that channel

The highest-priority rule wins.
This is exactly how Discord handles its permissions.

🎯 TL;DR

Your permissions system should:

Use roles to define default abilities

Use channels to override rules

Let you allow/deny specific actions

Let you hide channels from certain people

Let you create read-only channels

Work exactly like Discord’s permission hierarchy
