🎨 NEW THEME TO APPLY (NebulaCore)

Replace the current tiles/cards UI with this:

Background

Full-screen dark nebula background

Deep blue → teal → purple swirling gradient

Soft blurry glow in the center

Subtle moving star particles

Slight noise texture for depth

Dynamic Title (NEW FEATURE)

Replace the static “Hey there” title with a randomized rotating greeting.

On each page load or returning to the site, randomly choose one greeting:

"Hey there"

"Welcome back"

"Ready to explore?"

"What’s good?"

"Back for more?"

"Let’s get moving"

"Your hub awaits"

"Loading the universe…"

"Returning to orbit"

Important:

This greeting must change ONLY on load/refresh.

Must NOT break any scripts or UI layout.

Subtitle stays: "Search the web privately"
