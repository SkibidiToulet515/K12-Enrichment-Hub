also I want to create a fully functional YouTube video card system for my website, like VaporV3. Follow these steps:

Set a predefined playlist or channel:

No user input needed.
Hardcode a playlist ID or channel ID in the script.
Fetch video metadata using YouTube Data API v3:

Title
Thumbnail image
Short description
Video duration
Generate video cards dynamically:

Each card should include thumbnail, title, short description, and duration overlay.
Display them in a responsive grid:
1 column on mobile
2–3 columns on tablet
4–5 columns on desktop
Add hover animations for cards:

Slight scale-up (zoom)
Drop shadow or glow effect
Smooth transition
Play icon overlay appears smoothly on hover
Add click functionality:

Clicking a card replaces it with a YouTube nocookie iframe embed.
Smooth fade-in animation for iframe.
Fullscreen capable.
Additional animations:

Cards fade in when scrolling into view.
Thumbnails load with blur-to-sharp transition.
Styling (mandatory, modern aesthetic):

Rounded corners for cards
Drop shadows
Proper spacing and padding between cards
Smooth transitions for hover and click
Use only vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS:

No frameworks or external libraries.
Code should be lightweight and run directly on a Render-hosted static site.
Output:

Complete, copy-paste-ready HTML, CSS, and JS.
Fully functional, polished, responsive, with all animations, hover effects, and click-to-play behavior included.
Optional but recommended:

Lazy-load images for performance.
