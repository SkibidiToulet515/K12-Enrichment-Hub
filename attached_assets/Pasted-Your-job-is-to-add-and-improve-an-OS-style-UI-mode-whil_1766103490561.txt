Your job is to add and improve an OS-style UI mode while keeping all existing systems, logic, and features fully intact.

This project must feel human-built, realistic, polished, and production-quality — not AI-generated or template-like.

1️⃣ ABSOLUTE RULE (READ FIRST)

EVERYTHING THAT WORKS NOW MUST CONTINUE TO WORK EXACTLY THE SAME.

This includes:

Login system

Guest access

Permissions

Admin panel

Chat

Forums

Games

Media

Profiles

Themes

Tools

Backend logic

Routes

Database structure

You are primarily changing HOW IT LOOKS, not HOW IT WORKS.

2️⃣ LOGIN SYSTEM (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
✅ KEEP THE CURRENT REAL LOGIN SYSTEM

A real login system already exists.

You MUST:

Keep the same authentication logic

Keep the same validation

Keep the same database structure

Keep the same permissions

Keep guest mode behavior exactly the same

✅ You MAY improve:

Login UI

Styling

Layout

Animations

Error message clarity

OS-style presentation

❌ You must NOT:

Rewrite auth logic

Replace login systems

Add new auth providers

Change how accounts work

Merge guest and user logic

Break existing accounts

Same engine. Better dashboard.

3️⃣ CORE GOAL — OS MODE (VISUAL MODE ONLY)

Add a toggleable OS-style interface mode.

OS Mode = visual/layout layer

Classic Mode = current layout, unchanged

Switchable instantly from Settings

No page reload required

This OS mode should feel like a browser-based desktop workspace, not a homepage.

4️⃣ TASKBAR (MANDATORY)

Add a persistent taskbar (bottom by default).

Includes:

App launcher

Pinned apps

Active app indicators

Notifications

Clock/date

User avatar

Settings shortcut

Behavior:

Always visible

Reflects open apps

Supports minimize / focus

Feels native and responsive

5️⃣ WINDOWED APPS

All existing features open in draggable, resizable windows in OS Mode.

Windows must support:

Open / close / minimize

Focus state

Subtle animations

Snap / resize (optional)

No fake macOS or Windows clones — keep it web-native.

6️⃣ SETTINGS APP (GLOBAL CONTROL CENTER)

Create ONE universal Settings app.

Includes:

Layout mode toggle (Classic / OS)

Theme selector

Theme creator (keep existing)

Font changer (global)

Notification settings

Accessibility options

Layout mode selector must include:

Two preview cards (illustrations, not screenshots)

Instant apply

Saved preference

7️⃣ CHAT & COMMUNITY (KEEP + IMPROVE UI)
KEEP ALL EXISTING LOGIC

Do NOT change permissions or backend rules unless explicitly stated.

REQUIRED FIXES & UI IMPROVEMENTS:

Fix forums so posting works

Chat input bar must stay fixed (like Discord)

Remove requirement for admin permission to create servers

Server & Group Features:

Rename server

Delete server

Invite via generated code

Kick / remove / timeout members

Roles & permissions

Subchannels

Mentions & Notifications:

Typing @ shows user list

Mentions trigger OS-style notifications

Click notification → opens correct app/message

Per-user notification preferences

8️⃣ ADMIN PANEL (MUST BE REAL)

Admin panel must:

Show real data, not placeholders

Show user stats, activity, reports

Allow moderation (ban, timeout, remove)

View bug reports

No fake metrics.

9️⃣ BUG REPORT SYSTEM

Add a Report a Bug feature:

Accessible to users

Sends description + context

Appears in Admin Panel

Status tracking (open/resolved)

🔟 PERFORMANCE (MANDATORY)

Implement:

Skeleton loading for UI content

Lazy loading only for heavy media

Zero layout shift

Smooth transitions

No lag spikes

1️⃣1️⃣ MUSIC APP

Add a Music app inside OS Mode.

Technical rules:

Use YouTube Data API

NO embeds

NO iframes

API used only for:

Search

Metadata

Thumbnails

Filter results to music-only

Behavior:

Native-feeling music app UI

Opens in window

Mini-player integrates with taskbar

Graceful fallback if playback blocked

Guests can browse, not save

1️⃣2️⃣ KEEP ALL FEATURES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All existing features MUST remain:

Games

Media

Chat

Forums

Profiles

Themes

Tools

Admin controls

Guest mode

Fake/demo access where applicable

Nothing removed. Nothing downgraded.

1️⃣3️⃣ ZERO-ERROR REQUIREMENT (VERY SERIOUS)

You MUST:

Check EVERY file

Debug EVERY feature

Validate logic and UI

Check each file at least 19 times

Fix:

Console errors

Broken UI

Broken routes

Permission issues

If something cannot be completed, you MUST explain why.

1️⃣4️⃣ HUMAN QUALITY REQUIREMENT

Final result must:

Look intentionally designed

Avoid generic AI UI patterns

Use realistic spacing and motion

No placeholder text

No fake content

No demo-style layouts

This should feel like:

“A real web OS someone actually uses.”

1️⃣5️⃣ REQUIRED FINAL CONFIRMATION

At completion, you MUST explicitly list:

Confirmation that login/auth logic was unchanged

Confirmation that guest mode behavior is unchanged

Confirmation that all features were preserved

Any environment variables or API keys I must add

Any manual steps I must take on Render/Replit
